# Concept Proposal

## Goals
- To create a streaming platform that is able to handle native sharing capabilities.
- To be able to promote smaller independent artists, and allow music streaming to be an actually profitable thing for them.

## Context
Currently there are a few music streaming platforms that dominate the market, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and YouTube music. Each of these has their benefits, but they are very similar. I want to provide a different experience than you would get on these platforms. I don't want you to feel like you are in this isolated space being fed music stricly by an AI, I want you to be able discover music recommended by the community and other like minded people. None of the platforms listed have any sort of real social component, even if you are able to "friend" people. There is little innovation in this space and I would like to push the music streaming industry in a direction it feels like so many other industries are going (think Strava, Instagram, etc.).

## Novelty
- There currently does not exist a music streaming platform (at least one anyone has ever heard of) that has a native social media component
- Would lend a lot to the music discovery and listening experience if it was easy and comfortable to share and recieve recommendations from people close to you.

## Functionality
- Create a generic streaming platform.
- Allow artists to have profiles as well as consumers.
- Artists can upload their music to this platform and can license it here.
- Users can search and find music, being able to play any music they come across.
- Users can create playlists, like songs, and build their own personalized library.
- Users can socially network, finding friends and building connections.
- Users can recommend music to others, whether that be through community posts or direct sharing.
  
## Audience
- The audience would be any casual music listener up to very intense music listeners.
- This project would specifically target the younger generation who is more comfortable with social media and who want to share their music with others.

## Challenges
- I think the biggest problems with this kind of implementation would simply be the music streaming aspect. Not necessarily the implementation but getting music put onto the platform and figuring out to pay out artists. This would likely be a future issue but still something that definitely will be challenging.
- Also storing the music files would be difficult as well, would likely have to utilize cloud storage.

## Measures
- Unit testing of functional requirements
- Beta testing and user feedback

## Motivation
I am a very passionate music listener, and I have found that it has been incredibly difficult to share music. Sure you can copy a link and send it via some external site, but if you are on Instagram or Facebook and want to share music, you don't copy links and send them, you send the actual content. That is why I want to build Rex, which centers around the social aspects of music listening, instead of making it feel like you are completely isolated while listening to music.

## Future Extensions
- Creating a beta version on the App Store.
- Working to get an artist on the platform and have their music licensed.
