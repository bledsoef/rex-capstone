## Novelty
- There currently does not exist a music streaming platform (at least one anyone has ever heard of) that has a native social media component
- Would lend a lot to the music discovery and listening experience if it was easy and comfortable to share and recieve recommendations from people close to you.

## Functionality
- Create a generic streaming platform.
- Allow artists to have profiles as well as consumers.
- Artists can upload their music to this platform and can license it here.
- Users can search and find music, being able to play any music they come across.
- Users can create playlists, like songs, and build their own personalized library.
- Users can socially network, finding friends and building connections.
- Users can recommend music to others, whether that be through community posts or direct sharing.
  
## Audience
- The audience would be any casual music listener up to very intense music listeners.
- This project would specifically target the younger generation who is more comfortable with social media and who want to share their music with others.

## Challenges
- I think the biggest problems
