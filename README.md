## Scope

The scope of this project extends much further than is feasible in the timeframe of this course. However, for the purposes of this time, the Scope of this project is a music streaming platform that allows users to play any music in the database, but this music will be limited to free use and public domain music. Anything having to do with bringing artists onto the platform or music licensing is far out of scope for this capstone. There will also be a social media component to this application, where ideally we will have some beta users on board testing it. However, there will be no promotions or sponsorships in the scope of this project.

## Vision
Practically every content creation site has native sharing and socializing capabilities; that is, except music content platforms. My vision is a music streaming platform (much like your Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music) but with the social components of something like Strava (a social activity tracking sight). I want to enable music listeners to be social, spread their music, and more fairly compensate and promote small artists.

## Prerequisites

I will be creating this with React Native, meaning it can be used on any platform, but I will be primarily targetting it for iOS. This means React Native, Cocoapods, Node.js and Expo all need to be installed. Unfortunately, getting it pushed onto the App store is a long, expensive process, so I may make it cross platform so there is an easily accessible website version as well.

## Acknowledgments

- I initally did a project similar to this for a hackathon. Even though the idea was my own and I will likely not use any of the same code, I still want to credit Stevenson Michel, Ali Ramazani, and Daize Njounkeng.
