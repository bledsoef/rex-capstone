# *Rex*
## Description/Motivation

I am a very passionate music listener, and I have found that it has been incredibly difficult to share music. Sure you can copy a link and send it via some external site, but if you are on Instagram or Facebook and want to share music, you don't copy links and send them, you send the actual content. That is why I want to build Rex, which centers around the social aspects of music listening, instead of making it feel like you are completely isolated while listening to music.

### Prerequisites

I intend on making this a mobile application, and would like this to be primarily targeted towards IOS devices though. This means it will likely need a Flutter Install or a Swift install. Unfortunately, getting it pushed onto the App store is a long, expensive process, so I may make it cross platform so there is an easily accessible website version as well.

### Project Concept
- [Project Concept](https://github.com/CSC493-Computing-Design-Practicum/csc493-cdp-bledsoef)

## Built With

- [Swift]([http://www.aframework1.io/](https://www.swift.org/)): Apple's development tool/language for IOS and MacOS applications.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): A cross-platform development tool by Google that allows code to be developed in one place and be applicable to multiple platforms.
- IDE, if applicable

## Acknowledgments

- I initally did a project similar to this for a hackathon. Even though the idea was my own and I will likely not use any of the same code, I still want to credit Stevenson Michel, Ali Ramazani, and Daize Njounkeng.
