### Project Concept
- [Project Concept](https://github.com/CSC493-Computing-Design-Practicum/csc493-cdp-bledsoef/blob/main/concept.md)

## Scope

The scope of this project extends much further than is feasible in the timeframe of this course. However, for the purposes of this time, the Scope of this project is a music streaming platform that allows users to play any music in the database, but this music will be limited to free use and public domain music. Anything having to do with bringing artists onto the platform or music licensing is far out of scope for this capstone. There will also be a social media component to this application, where ideally we will have some beta users on board testing it. However, there will be no promotions or sponsorships in the scope of this project.

## Vision
Practically every content creation site has native sharing and socializing capabilities; that is, except music content platforms. My vision is a music streaming platform (much like your Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music) but with the social components of something like Strava (a social activity tracking sight). I want to enable music listeners to be social, spread their music, and more fairly compensate and promote small artists.

## Prerequisites

I will be creating this with React Native, meaning it can be used on any platform, but I will be primarily targetting it for iOS. This means React Native, Cocoapods, Node.js and Expo all need to be installed. Unfortunately, getting it pushed onto the App store is a long, expensive process, so I may make it cross platform so there is an easily accessible website version as well.

## Design
- [Requirements](https://github.com/CSC493-Computing-Design-Practicum/csc493-cdp-bledsoef/blob/main/design.md)

## Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): An extension on React made to easily create cross platform applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed programming language extending off of JavaScript.
- [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/): A Tailwind CSS extension meant for React Native and cross platform development
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A quick, light, and scalable backend framework for creating endpoints in Python.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The primary programming language used for the backend development.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): A Python ORM used for interfacing with SQL DBs as an alternative to straight SQL.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): The relation SQL database used for content storage.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Used for cloud file storage like audio, profile pictures, album pictures, etc.

### About the Lead Developer
Finn Bledsoe is a senior Computer Science major at Berea College. Finn has been interning and gaining experience in software development for 3 years now. As passionate music consumers, Finn and his brother Jacob frequently shared music with each other. The problem? As they were sharing strictly on iMessage, music was falling between the cracks, consistently going unlistened to. That's when Finn wanted to make Rex, so he, his brother, and others, could better share music and make music a social experience.

## Acknowledgments

- I initally did a project similar to this for a hackathon. Even though the idea was my own and I will likely not use any of the same code, I still want to credit Stevenson Michel, Ali Ramazani, and Daize Njounkeng.
