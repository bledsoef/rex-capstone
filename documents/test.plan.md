# Project Test Plan
### By Finn Bledsoe

## Introduction
This test plan will outline the testing methodologies and priorities when it comes to ensuring Rex is functional and all cases are covered. 

### Scope
Due to limited time, in the scope of the capstone, integration testing, pipelines, and performance testing are all likely out of the scope of this issue. The testing methodologies that will be included in this test plan will include UI testing, unit testing, and cross platform testing (if time allows).

### Tools
I plan on using Pytest for unit testing, and utilizing expo to create builds for non iOS systems to test cross platform functionality.

### Individual Cases can be found under the Github Issues tab

The requirements for each individual test case will look like this:
- **Test case number:** 
- **Requirement number:** 
- **Preconditions:** 
- **Steps:** 
- **Desired results:**
